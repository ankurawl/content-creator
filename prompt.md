## Topic
How AI Skills Are Becoming Essential for Career Security in Tech

## Target Audience

- Tone: Professional but accessible, data-informed but not academic

---

## Core Thesis
Tech layoffs have evolved from pandemic-driven overcorrection (2022-23) and macroeconomic pressure (2023-24) to productivity-driven workforce optimization (2024-25+). Companies are reallocating resources from labor costs to AI infrastructure investments, creating a skills gap that employees can bridge by mastering AI tools.

## Data Requirements

### Priority Data (Must Include)
1. **3-5 specific examples** of major tech companies with:
   - Announced layoff numbers (2022-2025)
   - AI infrastructure investment announcements
   - Publicly stated productivity/efficiency goals

2. **2-3 aggregate statistics** such as:
   - Industry-wide revenue per employee trends
   - Total tech layoffs by year (2022-2025)
   - Announced AI capex from top 5 tech companies

### Data Sources
- Company earnings calls and investor presentations
- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) for public companies
- Layoff tracking databases (e.g., Layoffs.fyi, TechCrunch reporting)
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, IDC, if available)

### Data Scope Limitations
- **Focus on 5-7 major public tech companies** (Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.)
- **Time range: 2022-2025** (don't go back 10 years)
- **Private company data**: Use reliable news reports and company announcements 
- **Acceptable data gaps**: If specific metrics aren't available, use proxies or state limitations

## Key Arguments to Support

1. Layoff motivations have fundamentally shifted from reactive (pandemic, macro) to strategic (productivity transformation)

2. The financial calculus has changed: Companies are trading labor opex for AI capex/opex with expectation of multiplied productivity

3. This is not cyclical belt-tightening—it's structural workforce transformation

4. AI productivity gains are already measurable in forward-looking companies

5. Employee agency matters: Skills development is actionable career protection

## Success Criteria

The article should:
- [ ] Present clear data showing the correlation between AI investment and workforce changes
- [ ] Acknowledge the evolution of layoff drivers without dismissing earlier factors
- [ ] Make a convincing case that AI skills matter without being alarmist
- [ ] Be accessible to non-technical readers while satisfying data-oriented readers
- [ ] Provide actionable takeaway (upskilling direction)
- [ ] Maintain balanced tone (not fear-mongering, not dismissive)

---

## Research Process

1. Start with web search for recent layoff announcements and AI investment data
2. Focus research on 3-5 specific companies (include public and private) for detailed examples
3. Look for revenue/employee or productivity metrics in investor materials
4. Identify 2-3 executive quotes about AI and productivity
5. Write article synthesizing findings
6. Ensure all claims are supported by cited sources
