# Tech Layoffs Aren't Slowing Down. The Reason Has Changed.

Why are tech companies still cutting jobs despite record profits? The answer has shifted three times since 2022. The current phase represents a structural transformation, not cyclical belt-tightening.

## The Pandemic Correction: 2022-2023

Tech companies nearly doubled their headcount between 2019 and 2022 to meet pandemic demand. When growth slowed, the correction was severe. Meta cut 11,000 employees in November 2022—13% of its workforce, followed by another 10,000 in March 2023. Amazon eliminated 27,000 positions across three rounds. Google reduced headcount from 190,234 in 2022 to 182,502 by end of 2023. Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 Meta's "Year of Efficiency." Companies were simply unwinding their overhiring.

## The Economic Squeeze: 2023-2024

As pandemic corrections stabilized, economic headwinds drove the next wave. Rising interest rates and profitability pressure forced efficiency gains. At least 95,000 U.S. tech workers lost jobs in 2024, even as some companies slowly rebuilt headcount. Google grew modestly to 183,323 employees by late 2024. 

## The AI Reallocation: 2024-2025

The financial calculus changed in 2024. Companies began trading labor costs for AI infrastructure at unprecedented scale. Amazon announced $125 billion in AI capital expenditure for 2025, up from a previous $118 billion forecast. Google raised its 2025 capex guidance to $91-93 billion. Microsoft committed $80 billion. Meta allocated $70-72 billion. Combined, these four companies shared plans to spend over $320 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, a 30% increase from $246 billion in 2024 which was already extraordinary. 

Tech leaders framed the shift explicitly. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June 2025 that "we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today" as the company adopts AI tools. He called AI "the most transformative technology of our lifetime." Mark Zuckerberg predicted on the Joe Rogan podcast that AI would "effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer at your company that can write code" by 2025. Google's Sundar Pichai pushed employees to "accomplish more" through AI, noting the company's engineering productivity had already increased 10%. Microsoft's Satya Nadella said future headcount would "grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI."

The workforce impact was immediate. Microsoft cut 15,000 jobs in 2025. Amazon eliminated 14,000 corporate roles. Meta reduced its workforce by 5%. By year-end 2025, 55,000 U.S. tech layoffs were directly attributed to AI restructuring.

## The Productivity Bet

The math explains why. Meta's revenue per employee jumped 56.66% from $1.56 million in 2023 to $2.44 million in 2024—the steepest increase among major tech firms. Microsoft's revenue per employee climbed 20.4% from $897,000 in 2022 to $1.08 million in 2024. Alphabet saw revenue per employee rise 18.69% in 2024 alone, reaching $1.92 million after a 2023 dip. Apple maintained the highest efficiency at $2.51 million per employee in 2025.

Companies are reallocating resources from labor to AI infrastructure with the expectation of multiplied productivity gains. This is a structural workforce transformation, not a cyclical adjustment. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky stated the company expects capex "to increase in 2026" beyond 2025's record levels. Meta signaled 2026 spending would be "notably larger" than 2025. Tech companies are betting they can achieve internal productivity multipliers before broader AI adoption and resulting efficiency gains among their competitors. 

## What This Means for Workers

For employees, the path forward is clear: boost your own productivity by learning and leveraging AI in your work. AI skills are no longer a differentiator, they're table stakes. The companies making the largest AI investments are the same ones reshaping their workforces around expected productivity gains. 

The layoffs aren't ending. They're evolving into a new equilibrium where fewer workers, amplified by AI tools, deliver more value.
