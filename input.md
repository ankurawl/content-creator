## Core Thesis

Tech layoffs have evolved: 
i) in 2022-23, layoffs were due to the correction of pandemic-driven overhiring, 
ii) in 2023-24, layoffs were due to macroeconomic environment like rising interest rates and profitability pressure, 
iii) in 2024-25-26, the layoffs are due to companies spending more on AI capex and hence less on employees, as well as optimization of workforce structure with the expected productivity-boost in the coming years. 

Conclusion: 
- Companies are reallocating resources from labor costs to AI infrastructure investments. The shift is structural workforce transformation, not cyclical belt tightening. 
- The financial calculus has changed: Companies are trading labor opex for AI capex with expectation of multiplied productivity. 
- Employees have agency. The best way for employees to stay relevant is to boost their own productivity by learning and leveraging AI in their work. AI skills are no longer a differentiator, but an important component to ensuring job security.
