# README.md 

This file gives step by step instructions on how to use this content creator repository. 

## Purpose

This is a content creation workspace for generating data-driven articles. The workflow uses a template-based approach where topic-specific content is defined in `prompt.md` and the generated article is written to `article.md`.

## File Structure

- **prompt.md**: Input - Article writing template with Topic-specific content. 
- **article.md**: Output - File containing the article generated by claude code. 

## Workflow

1. Start FMP MCP Server 

```bash
# Start the server
./start-fmp-server.sh
```

2. Modify the "TOPIC-SPECIFIC CONTENT" section in `prompt.md`:
   - Define the topic and core argument
   - Specify required data and research
   - Outline key points to address

3. Start Claude Code and Verify that the MCP server is running 

```bash
# Start claude code 
claude code 
``` 

In claude code, 
```
/mcp
``` 

4. Drag the `prompt.md` to the prompt in claude code 

See the magic happen.
